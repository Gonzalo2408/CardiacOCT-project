# CardiacOCT project

## Abstract

## Explain code + folders

## TODO:
 - Train data with second dataset included
 - Build metrics Excel with both datasets results (including DICE results per region, plots, etc)
 - Solve NaN problem with 3d version of (first/second??) dataset --> impute -1 once preprocessing is done
 - Figure out post-processing techniques for lipid arc and cap thickness measurements (using dynammic programming + semantic segmentation of lipid, lumen, intima, etc). 
 For this, check [Lee et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24884-1) and [Wang et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370980/)
