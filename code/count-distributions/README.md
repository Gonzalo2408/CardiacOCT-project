## Labels distributions

In this folder, you can find some scripts for data analysis. In particular, two scripts retrieve the labels distributions in the original dataset and the automated segmentations. A finals script retrieves the class weight for each label based on its frequency. This class weight has been applied for different trainings, as specified in the main page description.

The results can be seen in the Excel files in the [counts](/info-files/counts/) folder.
