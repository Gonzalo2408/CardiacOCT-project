## Model report

In this folder, a summary of a model prediction is generated as pdf. An overview can be seen in the figure below. The model report contains, for a given model and every frame in the test set:
 - OCT frame
 - Manual annotation
 - Model segmentation
 - Lipid arc and FCT measurements for the predicted segmentation
 - Calcium arc, thickness and depth for the predicted segmentation
 - Table that compare TCFA, calcium score, sidebranch, white and red thrombus, dissection and plaque rupture for the manual and predicted annotations.
